"Netflix is a waste of money üí∞ they‚Ä¶: Read the books and so was curious to see what Netflix made of it. Bought a blu ray boxed set from Ebay. These discs turned out to be pirated (from China, complete with printed discs, sleeves etc), but played as they should. What a jolt! The first season wasn‚Äôt terrible, one book given 10 episodes. Some odd changes and deeply peculiar editing, but nevermind. Season 2 was where it came apart. 2 books shoehorned into a measly 8 episodes. The editing was an amateurish mess, really some of the worst we‚Äôve seen. Changes to the characters and plot were FAR beyond demented, utterly without rhyme or reason, most of it now no longer making any sense at all. A lesbian couple, who sort of were in the book (very briefly), now had a child, who wasn‚Äôt, and this was done insultingly half-heartedly, interfered with the pace and took up valuable running time which would have been better used for other elements of the story, but just to do this to parade your ‚Äòwoke‚Äô credentials glaringly revealed how ‚Äòunwoke‚Äô the producers of this botched series really are. Lazy cut and paste stuff to say the least. We were all surprised Richard Morgan signed-off (he was a consultant, apparently) on this evisceration of his work; Presumably the money was too good to turn down, but we wonder if he was even there at all.

"I enjoy the movies: You should be ashamed of yourselves. You know everyone is struggling to get by and rely on things like Netflix because they can't afford to do anything nice these days with everything costing so much.  Not only have you earned 1.8 billion more people because of your egotistical password crackdown.  You then further scrounge even more money from people who a desperately struggling.  It's greed!! pure ugly greed!!!  Wouldn't be surprised now if everyone banded together to get rid of Netflix until prices are dropped. It's ridiculous.  My Netflix is now costing me nearly 30 quid a month!!!, that is outrageous!! You are scraping money from the backs of poor people.  And because they have kids they need to have things like this to entertain their kids.  So not only are you now taking money from people to make their lives harder.  You're risking people not being able to afford it and causing so many family problems for they can't afford it for their kids.  It's horrible what you are doing to people.  It was bad enough putting the prices up as high as you did.  I as primary user gets charged an extra 5 pound for the added account and then 5 pound again to add a extra member. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.  If things don't change I will be getting rid of Netflix and I'm sure another company will step up and take your place to make it easier on the people are struggling.  You're making billions!!!!  Yet trying to scrounge more off poor people. Shameful!!  Where is the empathy?? Where is the looking after your customers!?  Where is the understanding??  We as customers should be getting rewarded by not having every penny drained by you! And not being punished for having your company as a go to application. You really should hold your heads down. You're making people struggle to the point of barely being able to afford it anymore. I'm absolutely disgusted you would treat people like this. GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY!!!!! Why couldn't you have just done it by just a simple 5 pound per person instead of charging even more for the primary user just to add people and then extra on top for each person added!!!  And this password crackdown is making it impossible for families that move around a lot, it's horrific. Just goes to show the greed capacity and says a lot about you as a company. A bunch of greedy selfish money hungry monsters.  Why not just 5 found in total for the added person and that's that and let them watch it anywhere they are. Why complicate things to a degree where its stressful for everyone involved.  Can see your company being boycotted soon and it will be no ones fault but your own.  People and their struggles should matter to you. But it doesn't, does it!?!?  Do you not care that people are struggling??? It's a cost of living crisis and you've now put your cost up 3 times!!!   You are monsters.  It's distigusting and unfair to the primary user and everyone else imvolved.  You're preying on poor people is what you are doing!!! Your platform will drop soon. People will leave. People won't tolerate being ripped off blind by greedy a holes.

It now takes about 20 minutes to go through titles trying to find something that I haven't seen that is in the English language. That's absolutely ridiculous how many foreign movies they have. There are a few subtitled movies that are decent but when you are putting pretty much every movie ever made from every other country around the world that's a bit much. Also when you do happen across a series that is worth watching, they make you wait way way way way too long before they continue it. That is if they continue it at all.

"Wish I could leave 0 stars: I have had the pleasure of using Netflix for quite some time now, and overall, my experience has been positive. Netflix has undoubtedly established itself as one of the leading streaming platforms available today, offering a vast library of movies, TV series, documentaries, and more. Here's my honest, helpful, and constructive review: What makes my experience with Netflix great is the convenience it provides. The user-friendly interface allows easy navigation through its extensive collection of content. With a simple search, I can find numerous options that cater to various genres and preferences. Furthermore, their personalized recommendation algorithm suggests new shows and movies based on my viewing habits, which often leads me to discover gems that I might have missed otherwise. The streaming quality on Netflix is generally excellent, with a broad range of viewing options, including 4K Ultra HD and HDR content. I also appreciate the ability to watch on multiple devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs, offering flexibility and convenience for users on the go. Netflix's original content has played a significant role in its success. Their commitment to producing high-quality original series and films showcases their dedication to storytelling. With shows like ""Stranger Things,"" ""The Crown,"" and ""Narcos,"" Netflix has exhibited its ability to captivate audiences with unique and engaging narratives. I am particularly impressed by their willingness to take risks and offer diverse stories that cater to various demographics. However, one aspect that could use some improvement is the content library. While Netflix does offer a wide selection, it is not immune to the occasional gap in certain genres or regional restrictions. This can sometimes be frustrating, especially when a particular movie or TV show is not available or has limited availability in my region. Nevertheless, Netflix has consistently invested in expanding its content library and continues to strike deals with renowned studios and distributors. They've also expanded their platform to include international content, catering to a more global audience. This continuous growth shows a commitment to enhancing the user experience. In terms of affordability, Netflix's subscription plans vary, allowing users to choose a plan that suits their streaming needs and budget. New features like downloading shows for offline viewing and the option to create multiple profiles for different family members further elevate the viewing experience. Overall, Netflix is a highly admired streaming platform that stands out for its convenience, extensive content library, and original programming. Despite a few minor areas for improvement, it has undoubtedly reshaped the way we consume media and remains a top choice for entertainment enthusiasts worldwide.",1,2877,wish leave 0 star pleasure Netflix time overall experience positive Netflix undoubtedly establish lead stream platform available today offer vast library movie TV series documentary here honest helpful constructive review make experience Netflix great convenience provide userfriendly interface allow easy navigation extensive collection content simple search find numerous option cater genre preference furthermore personalized recommendation algorithm suggest new show movie base view habit lead discover gem miss stream quality Netflix generally excellent broad range view option include 4 k Ultra HD HDR content appreciate ability watch multiple device smartphone tablet smart tv offer flexibility convenience user Netflixs original content play significant role success commitment produce highquality original series film showcase dedication storytelle show like Stranger thing Crown Narcos Netflix exhibit ability captivate audience unique engage narrative particularly impress willingness risk offer diverse story cater demographic aspect use improvement content library Netflix offer wide selection immune occasional gap certain genre regional restriction frustrating especially particular movie tv available limit availability region Netflix consistently invest expand content library continue strike deal renowned studio distributor ve expand platform include international content cater global audience continuous growth show commitment enhance user experience term affordability Netflixs subscription plan vary allow user choose plan suit streaming need budget New feature like download show offline viewing option create multiple profile different family member elevate view experience Overall Netflix highly admired stream platform stand convenience extensive content library original programming despite minor area improvement undoubtedly reshape way consume medium remain choice entertainment enthusiast worldwide

"If I could give zero stars I would: Multiple reasons why I am leaving netflix 1) Sometimes my wifi is not working so I use a cellular hot spot, still can't use devices because it is not part of the household. Netflix is no longer meant for travelers or people who might have to choose a wifi payment vs a cell phone bill payment or have wi-fi maintenance done.  2) I traveled to spend time with my Mother and Father, my mother has breast cancer and I wanted to watch a show that on netflix with them to have some family fun time. I couldn't log in because their TV was not part of the household.  We ended up signing up for  another streaming platform to watch a different movie.  3) I have to jump through hoops to be able to watch Netflix on my own devices when leaving the house. I guess Netflix isn't for the user.. it is just for the house.  I used to think Netflix was a family friendly streaming platform....they are just greedy. I spend a lot of time with family and friends who have cable and don't watch  on streaming platforms and this definitely turned them off from becoming a part of the Netflix Club.

It is extremely low quality and formulaic content that is primarily produced in the 'cheapest' places on the planet. Many movies are poorly dubbed and have poor plots, poor acting, and poor stories.

"Just had to Lower my subscription and‚Ä¶: Coming to a screen near you conovision by Netflix. A rip off never seen before in the history of streaming. A tale so terrifying that it will leave you gripped to the edge of your seat and your bank balance smaller. So, Netflix are clamping down on password sharing. This new rule, designed to extract as much money out of your pocket as possible has now hit the UK. So firstly, what is wrong with password sharing? In my view nothing within reason. Firstly, some essential information. It is reported that in the UK in 2022 61% of people owned a HD or HD Ready TV. 22% owned a 4k or UHD TV. So that leaves 17% who for whatever reason do not. I found it hard to actually find out how many UK subscribers Netflix had in the UK. Most sites suggest around the 15 million level whilst others suggested as many as 24 million. Whatever the number it is big and even bigger when you multiply it by how much they charge. Netflix offers 3 main packages to its subscribers Basic which allows just one person to watch at any one time in standard definition Standard which allows two people to watch at the same time but in High Definition Premium which allows up to 4 people to watch in 4k or Ultra High Definition at the same time. Initially, I bought a standard subscription which allowed two people to watch at the same time. Owning a HD TV, I obviously wanted to watch in HD. But I live alone. Some years later I then upgraded to 4k and of course, I upgraded my subscription so I could get the best out of my TV. The problem is that Netflix‚Äôs packages discriminate against single people. It is called Singlism. What their Premium package actually says is that you can watch your shows in glorious ultra-high definition but if you are single then that is tough because you cannot share that very expensive subscription with anyone else outside of your household. Being single and living in your household usually means you cannot share it with anyone else in your household because there isn‚Äôt anyone else living in your household to share it with. If you get my drift. So, I being a good dad allowed my two daughters to use the spare logins so that they could make use of my awfully expensive subscription but now they cannot anymore and even worse they cannot afford their own. So, I am being penalised for being single which may be a breach of law under the 2010 Equalities Act. This is called Singlism. My daughters miss out altogether. Surely that is not good for customer relations and certainly not a great way to treat your customers.  I now pay ¬£15.99 per month for my one-person-only subscription because I am single and want to watch Netflix on my glorious 65-inch 4k TV in Ultra High Definition. I had allowed my sister to use my subscription and for her to continue to do that my bill has gone up to ¬£20.98 a month. If I add my two daughters, then my subscription would be ¬£30.93 a month. Twice as much as anyone shares with 3 others in the same household. How is this resolved? Well to be honest I already have Prime, and my daughter has Disney and so I could cancel Netflix but that would leave my sister paying a bigger monthly bill. Now we pay ¬£10.49 each but if I cancelled then her subscription would go up to ¬£15.99. Of course, maybe it is time for Netflix to re-evaluate their subscriptions taking into account that not everyone who wants UHD lives with other people and is therefore able to share. That would be the right thing to do. If they do not, then maybe, just maybe they are breaching the equalities act by penalising single people.",1,3594,lower subscription come screen near conovision Netflix rip see history stream tale terrifying leave grip edge seat bank balance small Netflix clamp password share new rule design extract money pocket possible hit UK firstly wrong password sharing view reason firstly essential information report UK 2022 61 people own HD HD Ready tv 22 own 4k UHD TV leave 17 reason find hard actually find UK subscriber Netflix UK site suggest 15 million level whilst suggest 24 million number big big multiply charge Netflix offer 3 main package subscriber Basic allow person watch time standard definition Standard allow people watch time High Definition Premium allow 4 people watch 4k Ultra High Definition time initially buy standard subscription allow people watch time own HD tv obviously want watch hd live year later upgrade 4k course upgrade subscription good tv problem Netflixs package discriminate single people call Singlism premium package actually say watch show glorious ultrahigh definition single tough share expensive subscription outside household single live household usually mean share household not live household share drift good dad allow daughter use spare login use awfully expensive subscription anymore bad afford penalise single breach law 2010 Equalities Act call Singlism daughter miss altogether surely good customer relation certainly great way treat customer   pay 1599 month onepersononly subscription single want watch Netflix glorious 65inch 4k tv Ultra High Definition allow sister use subscription continue bill go 2098 month add daughter subscription 3093 month twice share 3 household resolve honest Prime daughter Disney cancel Netflix leave sister pay big monthly bill pay 1049 cancel subscription 1599 course maybe time Netflix reevaluate subscription take account want UHD live people able share right thing maybe maybe breach equality act penalise single people

By doing so it puts more focus on their ""changes"", than to the amazing story for the viewers, having the opposite effect that I presume they were going for. However they also seem to have a decent variety of Comedy, Action, Horror, Casual, Anime, etc with famous popular series and movies that the majority enjoy, such as Friends, Seinfeld, The Office, Arrested Development, The IT Crowd, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and more. I'm not a big fan of their latest pricing changes, and what I've heard they've been doing in other countries about people using the same account who don't live under the same roof, so if that ever comes into effect here, I will definitely cancel.

I enjoy the movies: Netflix Korea does not have English subtitles for many of their best Korean Shows in Korea. When talking to a representative they will say a show is not produced by Netflix. Watch that show in a different country and It is a Netflix Production. They lied right there. Netflix does not have the distribution rights for these Korean shows in Korea. A local Korean company does which blocks all subtitling in another language in Korea. Does Netflix Korea release the subtitle file so that it can be used on a computer to subtitle the show? No. It is the opposite. It corrupts the subtitling by removing a few seconds of the show here and there to throw off the timing. The Koreans complain about the Japanese during the occupation forcing them to speak Japanese. This type of action means that they are jealous of the power that the Japanese wielded over them to destroy their history and heritage. For me this is an inconvenience because Netflix doesn't want me to watch many of the best Korean shows in Korea. The real reason can only be speculated on. The fact is that this Netflix Korea policy is forcing me to go to pirating sites. This is like prohibition of alcohol in the US. Organized crime got rich on people trying to legislate morality when the public wanted a drink.  Allowing translation subtitling would basically cut into the demand for the pirating sites because the quality of the streams could be pretty bad. A subtitle costs Netflix virtually nothing to stream along with the show makes this very suspicious. The pirating site depends on advertising which is dependent on viewership numbers. I receive threatening letters when I watch the show on a Netflix site outside of Korea. Outside of Korea the site can have over 12 languages for subtitles. The fact of the matter is when I am not watching a show on Netflix I am lowering the alleged demand and resultant value of the show. I have a strong feeling that something smells rotten here with distributors and Netflix Korea in addition to the pirate streamers getting re-reimbursed somehow for keeping the subtitles off of Netflix Korea. The only other explanation is I am dealing with a bunch of language fascists like the Japanese. With that however I don't see the profit in anyone's actions.

"1 star as I can‚Äôt give any lower‚Ä¶: I used to pirate stuff way back when companies made it too hard or inconvenient to purchase legally. When Netflix came out originally, I stopped pirating over night. Back then, it was super convenient, affordable, and hassle-free.  Today, Netflix has turned into garbage. Firstly, it monitors your screen and blacks out the feed if it thinks its being recorded. So whats the issue? Well, if you're using a M1 macbook and can't natively support 3 monitors, you can get an app called Displaylink which extends your screens to 3 or 4, but Netflix falsely detects this as a screen recorder. There's no way to dispute it, you're just stuck disassembling your setup and forced to watch it on a 13"" screen. Next, my sister and I used an account together. When we paid for the premium account, it allowed for 4k feeds and up to 4 people using it consecutively. Well, their greed finally caught up to them and they decided that didn't make them enough money. Now they care if the 4 people don't live at the same address and force you to pay for an extra account. So my gullible sister did it and purchased an add-on for me to be able to use her account. So now we are paying nearly twice as much. Worst of all, the service is not even the same as it was, but is now worse. In the past, since 4 people could view consecutively, my room mate would use the account on the main TV while I watched in my room. Again, this was the advertised service so it wasn't like we were abusing Netflix. Well, Netflix once again decided that multiple people cannot use the same account even if they live together, so now I am paying for a service I am not even able to use.  So thanks Netflix. As soon as this month is up, I am cancelling this trash service and am going back to downloading the shows instead - at least until they bring back their old premium plans and make it less of a pain to use.",1,1909,1 star not low pirate stuff way company hard inconvenient purchase legally Netflix come originally stop pirate night super convenient affordable hasslefree   today Netflix turn garbage firstly monitor screen black feed think record s issue M1 macbook not natively support 3 monitor app call Displaylink extend screen 3 4 Netflix falsely detect screen recorder s way dispute stuck disassemble setup force watch 13 screen sister account pay premium account allow 4k feed 4 people consecutively greed finally catch decide not money care 4 people not live address force pay extra account gullible sister purchase addon able use account pay nearly twice bad service bad past 4 people view consecutively room mate use account main tv watch room advertised service not like abuse Netflix Netflix decide multiple people use account live pay service able use   thank Netflix soon month cancel trash service go download show instead   bring old premium plan pain use

Didn't require a password or credit card details to be entered to confirm or authorise the account to be restarted... nothing! Meanwhile we have logged out of that account on the TV etc and haven't been using it at all, which they can no doubt see on their system. I have just contacted Netflix to advise them that they have been incorrectly billing me and request a refund to be told they will only refund 1 of the 10 months that they have incorrectly charged me for. It's absolutely disgusting and deceptive behaviour and a serious security risk. Netflix's own system should automatically log every device out when an account gets cancelled and more importantly they should not have the ability to start changing someone‚Äôs card without authorisation by way of entering a password or credit card details.

The scary part is we were also advised that when you cancel you have to specifically tell them to remove your card as they keep your profile for 10 months so it can be restarted at any time. However they do not tell you this when  you have to ask them to remove the card. Very confusing and you only know this can happen if you work for Netflix as they will not actively tell you.

"Just had an email stating my plan is‚Ä¶: I spoke to an extremely rude and unhelpful customer service team tonight regarding getting fraudulently charged for the month of Oct and Nov due to someone creating a fake account under a different email address, and was using my card info on file for the second time in a row (the first call I made to Customer Service was in Oct '22 to end my account membership because of this same issue and then I got charged AGAIN for Oct and Nov '22 by a hacker outside of the US being able to still use my card and create a new account w/ an email address I don't have access to, same thing they did the first time around). Prior to the customer service team's 'supervisor' hanging up on me and not reimbursing for what I should have never been charged with towards the end Oct/Nov (since I had literally called them all earlier the month of Oct to alert them about the unusual charges with the same card); I requested to be sent information regarding devices that have been logging in with my card info since this other user had created a NEW account after I initially called customer service just a month and a half before (again, using a different email address I don't have access to from outside of the US). Instead of sending me this information, customer service gave me an email address to their privacy dept before hanging up on me mid-sentence. This email address doesn't respond to customer service claims according to the bounce back message I received, so I was frsutrated to say the least that I was given the run around regarding information I'm legally entitled to to file a fraud claim with my bank. The first customer service rep I spoke to back in Oct never gave me the option to completely block my card from being able to be used in the system again, which was an option offered to me tonight. Had she done this to begin with I would not have had to call customer service back a month and a half later with the same issue. Due to the incompetence I experienced by every person spoken to on the phone in regards to something as serious as users' personal/confidential info being so easily accessible to others I won't stream with Netflix again.

"Netflix allowed my account to be hacked.: Netflix used to be the BEST streaming service. Generally speaking, their servers are the quickest and the user interface is the friendliest out of all that I used (HBO Max, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, etc.) But their content is straight up trash. I respect anyone who wants to disagree, but as a younger millennial (currently in my early 30s), Netflix's agenda of pushing their woke content is becoming ridiculous. First they took away their review system and star ratings years back when I used to use them. That was helpful on what I could watch. Now, they don't provide that option. Then they had the thumbs up/down and they ditched that too. So everyday, they want to push their own crappy content to you and their endless amount of TV shows. If you pause something you're watching, a screen saver comes up with more pushy content. I did not pay for this crap. They don't even tell you what movies are foreign and don't make it clear what languages are default so when you start playing, you realize you have to watch subtitles. I'm ok with reading subtitles but not everyone is and it's not always convenient. Then, some of the dubbed content works but most don't so watching it takes away from the actors/actresses' true intentions/speech. It's not the same. A great example is Alice in Borderlands. Their synopsis writing for their selection is terrible. The synopsis doesn't tell you anything about the movie until you actually watch it and waste your time on some stupid story. A lot of them are also poorly written and don't make sense grammatically which is shocking for a billion-dollar company.  Then, because you can't find out what the movie is about or get an idea from other users/ratings, you have to look it up yourself or end up wasting your time watching their pushed content. They also have some of shuffle feature which shuffles their Netflix original and pushes it onto you. To add insult, they have the audacity to raise their subscription prices when they have absolutely no content. Unless you want to turn something on for background noise or waste your time laughing at how bad a lot of their content on, don't even bother. I unsubscribed almost a year ago and never looked back and I don't miss Netflix at all. I also cancelled Hulu for the same reason and I'm aiming to canceling Prime Video too. Don't let these media companies control you.

Is it to try and capture the right emotion to an American audience?  Does the scene itself not convey the emotions properly?  I just do not understand it.  I don't know if the subtitles are like that for all shows and movies that are translated, but I suspect they might be.  It's constantly frustrating to see the wrong subtitles on the screen, because it makes watchers misread and misunderstand the characters.  I end up using different streaming sites to watch my dramas because others stick to the actual words that are said and do not add in extra words and phrases that aren't actually said on screen.  While I can just watch the shows without subtitles, there are certain shows I need subtitles for because I don't understand the vocabulary all the time (like in a law drama) but seeing that the subtitles can be wrong, makes it hard to properly tell and learn new words and phrases while watching.

Tired of subtitles: I have today cancelled my contract with Netflix. I am appalled and horrified that any streaming service would spew out such utter malicious garbage as 'The Crown' and refuse to issue a disclaimer. There are people all over the world who believe this grim fairy tale to be an accurate portrayal instead of a product of someone's fevered imagination. The royal family have recently been through an unbelievably difficult and sad time and Netflix chooses this moment to make up stories that are hotly denied by the living people portrayed in this dangerous dramatization and can only undermine their mental health. Shame on you Netflix and I can only hope that more people ditch this greedy streaming service which serves to profit from lies and make believe with total disregard to the welfare of the decent people they malign.,2,845,tired subtitle today cancel contract Netflix appal horrify streaming service spew utter malicious garbage Crown refuse issue disclaimer people world believe grim fairy tale accurate portrayal instead product someone fevere imagination royal family recently unbelievably difficult sad time Netflix choose moment story hotly deny live people portray dangerous dramatization undermine mental health Shame Netflix hope people ditch greedy streaming service serve profit lie believe total disregard welfare decent people malign

"Tripe!: Reasonably priced but it keeps rising. About a 5th of the stuff on there is decent/worth watching the rest is pretty dreadful filler. The majority of their own films are all filmed in exactly the same way right down to the editing and colour palette making it all samey and interchangeable. My biggest gripe is- if you pause watching anything on it for more than a few minutes their unadjustable screensaver kicks in which just tries to force their content down your throat. I'm already paying for it! Having suggested Adam Sandler films or whatever pop up every few seconds is infuriating. They say there's no adverts but clearly there is... For their stuff... Which I'm already watching and paying for. It's cheeky, underhanded and annoying. The business model of only being interested in new subscribers is deeply flawed and unsustainable. It's pyramid scheme mentality. If you've got an interest in older movies or basically anything made before the 90s then their library is seriously underwhelming. They're trying so hard to keep a grip on the market and in the wrong way that it's slipping through their fingers. I subscribe once every 3 months just to see if things have improved and they don't. The quality and quantity of things on offer at Disney plus, prime and now TV is way higher. I actually prefer scrolling through what YouTube has to offer than endlessly going through all the same suggestions but in different sections on Netflix. Need to up their game, improve the variety of content on the there and seriously upgrade how you find that content. Also, geoblocking is pretty pointless and reliant on people playing by rules which can can be easily bypassed. Why wait 6 months/however long/ never for your country's netflix to show something that's available in other countries and can be viewed through a VPN or found on websites?

I contacted my email service provider to check that my email account had not been compromised (hacked) and all was OK. So I asked Netflix either stop or refund me the payment which they had taken from my credit card, they said that they could not stop the payment but would make a refund which could take up to 30 days to complete. Not happy with this I contacted my bank and cancelled my credit card, then contacted Netflix again asking them to block my credit card and to make sure my account was cancelled. I had to provide them with the (cancelled) credit card details so that they could block the card and cancel my account with them.

I would never pay $10 for 480p quality and I hope no one else does either. The next package offered is 1080p for $17 after taxes. And then $21 for 4k.

"ability to watch with subtitles, in different languages, no ads, lots of content: July 2022 Watch out for unauthorized upcharges that will double your Netflix credit card debit! I had to jump through a lot of hoops but I was able to have the unauthorized upcharges reversed in full.  Here is my story. I read a note from an investment manager saying that he had reviewed his Netflix bill and discovered that Netflix had upgraded his account to premium usage and his bill had increased from $9 to $22/month. Several months had passed before he discovered the unauthorized upcharge. I looked at my account today, and in June, Netflix had done the same thing to my account. No one at my house requested the upgrade. I called customer service and the rep was trained to tell me that someone at my home requested the upgrade; Netflix would not do this on its own. I told the clerk that I had not taken affirmative action to request an upgrade. I suspect that Netflix buried an upgrade notification in an email that required me to respond to opt out of the upgrade. Who reads the flood of emails one gets from Netflix. Had this happened only to me, that would be one thing. But the investment advisor had the same experience. The clerk would only refund one month. When I spoke with the supervisor, he too told me that he was authorized to refund only one month. I have empathy for these Netflix employees because they need to work like the rest of us and it has to be tough to work for an unethical company. The supervisor did suggest that I call my bank to dispute the charge. So, I called Citibank, and the rep there was able to reverse the charge from two months ago on the spot.

"Resolution drops when price goes up: It seems that Netflix is cutting parts of scenes, when watching a quality program Not from Netflix the same movies and shows have more content that I didn't see on these same movies/shows! Also the audio goes out so that I have to go back over and over to hear what was said! That is continuous and it's maddening; is Every time and constant. My bandwidth is 30 mbp's on a 32"" tv ""standard"". Right now I can't even watch the show I'm trying to watch because audio-gone' issue continues through-out the entire show. And it's not the bandwidth that's the issue; because when there's no ""talking"" & just scenery, the audio stops completely until there's talking again, then it starts (not with the speaking, but hiccups through the speaking parts non stop until I just turn it off. That's because they are clipping parts out that has no need for audio in my opinion, & it's not the quality to the consumers that matter so that if it's not perfect & too much is cut out scenes or/and video, who cares! The shows they present for me are always what I've watched already and have more selections of ""watch it again"" than anything else. There's really no selection, and mostly shows Netflix knows are my disliked ratings and those that are similar instead of the other way around! ? Saving money by cutting out scenes and audio is one thing but why make my selections re-runs and disliked similar items? Too encourage an upgrade really doesn't make sense, it's not a lot more money, however; can save or give Netflix time's all customers! Finally, Netflix is a rip off in my opinion same as ""Amazon Prime"" movies/free movies! They just say they don't recognize my device and always remove it from my devices so that I can't watch them but still pay my monthly fees. (Back to Netflix) - Although it's only a few more bucks to upgrade , because I don't is good enough reason to keep cutting out wherever it saves Them $$.I don't use Netflix often, & do a binge here and there, going month's of never using it. It doesn't matter, a buck is a buck for them too. There needs to be some regulations with these huge company's even though I don't agree with all the regulations and censorship these regulatory agencies do. So, it's a matter of Not Subscribing or putting up with it and allowing these company's to Rip Off Consumers. It's the Only alternative for this kind of service & all theater/tv/movie services give that's a SURE Thing! Is Why Regulatory Agencies exist. They helped the consumer for awhile until Lobbying must have offered enough incentives to go after cable cutters and alternative services becuse of cable & communication services had a monopoly.

I hate to say it but I do not want to watch shows so dark they're actually disturbing in some way. Or shows mostly focused on trans and gay people having s-- left and right. I for a while had netflix on and off and back when they had good shows I enjoyed it. As they lost those contracts, they replaced them with garbage shows that contain bad acting or story lines so dark they are nauseating to watch.  I'm straight and I can't tell you how many times their algorithm has pushed gay and trans shows on me. The down vote doesn't always register so it fills up my algorithm with a ton of garbage I don't want to watch. Seasonal chrismas shows. I love a good christmas movie but there's no way to disable or turn off these things out side of their season.

The prestige of the platform has taken a tremendous hit and it feels like there is more foreign content on it than Hollywood-quality content.

"Resolution drops when price goes up: Netflix used to be good, despite quite major flaws such as poor interface and region locking. However in the past 4 years they have gone from bad, to worse, to now being worthless. They constantly raise prices with the claim it's to cover more new content, yet they add very few new movies each month and most of what they do add now is bollywood or reality trash. They continue to recycle the same old movies every 6-12 months, most of which were made pre-2000. And 99% of movies that should have forced subtitles are missing them, so any film featuring segments in a foreign language will be incomprehensible. The interface is useless, with no option to filter out anything you have already seen or don't want to see, nor can you filter by year, language, rating, popularity or any other useful metric. This continues to degrade, with them first removing reviews and then removing ratings entirely.

"Resolution drops when price goes up: 20 year ago, Netflix represented cutting edge technology.  Today, I find Netflix to be one step above useless.  I routinely suggest canceling the subscription, but my teen kids will point to one or two shows that they occasionally watch, and beg me to keep it.  Personally, I don't know the last time I searched for a movie on Netflix that they actually have.  I am not talking about obscure movies with a limited audience, but major blockbusters and academy award winners.  As a few examples, Netflix does NOT have: Marty (Oscar for best movie 1955), The A Team (2010 starring Liam Neeson), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958, 6 Oscar nominations), Star Trek (blockbuster Trilogy starring Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto), The Heiress (4 Oscar wins and best movie ever), The French Connection (Oscar for best movie 1971), The Hobbit (huge blockbuster), Lord of the Rings (huge blockbuster trilogy), Harry Potter (biggest movie series EVER).  Out of 93 Best Movie Oscar winners awarded since 1929, Netflix carries just 3 (Argo, My Fair Lady, Forest Gump), and I already own all of those on DVD.  Netflix has virtually no movies that I am interested in watching.  Obviously, they are more interested in pushing their own content, but that content is mostly targeted toward youngsters, so it has little appeal to an adult audience.  When I want to view a movie or a TV show, my standard procedure is to check Netflix, Amazon, and HULU.  They all seem to have the same inventory, so 99% of the time I end up watching my movie on some gray-web site for free.  It is frustrating that I spend $100+ per month for numerous ""legitimate"" streaming sites, and yet the vast majority of movies and shows I actually watch are on some Russian site where I must close down 20 porn pop-ups before I can actually see the movie.",1,1836,resolution drop price go 20 year ago Netflix represent cut edge technology   today find Netflix step useless   routinely suggest cancel subscription teen kid point show occasionally watch beg   personally not know time search movie Netflix actually   talk obscure movie limited audience major blockbuster academy award winner   example Netflix Marty Oscar good movie 1955 Team 2010 star Liam Neeson Cat Hot Tin Roof 1958 6 Oscar nomination Star Trek blockbuster Trilogy star Chris Pine   Zachary Quinto Heiress 4 Oscar win good movie french Connection Oscar good movie 1971 Hobbit huge blockbuster Lord Rings huge blockbuster trilogy Harry Potter big movie series   93 Best Movie Oscar winner award 1929 Netflix carry 3 Argo Fair Lady Forest Gump DVD   Netflix virtually movie interested watch   obviously interested push content content target youngster little appeal adult audience   want view movie tv standard procedure check Netflix Amazon HULU   inventory 99 time end watch movie grayweb site free   frustrating spend 100 month numerous legitimate streaming site vast majority movie show actually watch russian site close 20 porn popup actually movie

"Poor customer service: How I feel about Netflix.  Netflix is a great platform much better than any televsion cable television currently. And certainly a larger variety of shows than any other streaming service currently available. Netflix also has incredible options like allowing multiple users on one account. Or that they are always adding new content to their streaming service. Everyday, Netflix is looking to add more shows.  Some people complain that netflix has shows, but it's hard to tell what art is good and what is bad. Usually Netflix's algorithm will be able to provide you with shows that are interesting for you and not other people.  And while i write all of these positive things there is really one thing that separates netflix from a 5 star and 3 star.  And that's their use of subtitles.  Netflix butchers the subtitles on everything show and series of theres. For absolutely no reason.  I for the life of me cannot understand it.  If a character canc say a sentence with his mouth then someone can read at the same pace. If someone does not want to read subtitles, he can just deactivate them. But don't butcher all the subtitles on your site in order to appeal so some bull sheet aesthetic.  Netflix could be great. But they need to fix the user experience so that users can know that what they are reading is actually what's going on in the plot. Because the way they handle it right now does not provide us with that clarity.",1,1451,poor customer service feel Netflix   Netflix great platform well televsion cable television currently certainly large variety show streaming service currently available Netflix incredible option like allow multiple user account add new content streaming service Everyday Netflix look add show   people complain netflix show hard tell art good bad usually Netflixs algorithm able provide show interesting people   write positive thing thing separate netflix 5 star 3 star   s use subtitle   Netflix butcher subtitle series s absolutely reason   life understand   character canc sentence mouth read pace want read subtitle deactivate not butcher subtitle site order appeal bull sheet aesthetic   Netflix great need fix user experience user know read actually s go plot way handle right provide clarity

We thought it was our internet for a while because we couldn't imagine that Netflix would stream at such low quality.  But then after comparing to the other streaming platforms, we noticed that they all looked great on our TV and realized it must be a Netflix issue and so I googled it today and found out that because we're on the basic plan we only get the SD quality I mentioned above. If we want better looking movies on our TV then we have to pay for it by upgrading to Standard for full HD (1080p) for $13.99 or Premium for 4k quality for the cost of $17.99.  EVERY other platform out there gives high quality streaming for one price and most are far less than what you have to pay Netflix to get that same quality.  I never heard of such a thing and we're not willing to pay more to get the high quality we should be getting.

"Poor customer service: For those of you (maybe only a few) that do not have unlimited internet, Netflix insists on running advertisments automatically between shows.  Ontop of that, Many other little items I will add here that are completely unrequested by We the customer, run in the background also consuming data. Now again ONLY if your data package is restricted, this is a huge issue. Now sure, we can say these commercials and ads barely take any data. But it all adds up. And we do not request the ads. And how many hours do people watch netflix? Especially with Covid? How many Ads are they forced to watch? All the major media outlets wish to consistently brainwash and plant seeds of commercialism, like what to buy, what we may think that we need /want even, and what we should watch as far as entertainment goes. Now those reasons we cant really argue to big media corperations. They are all protected by the Govt. But, Due to financial reasons though as companies like this are forcing ads, thus forcing data usage, this is a form of theft in my opinion. If we end up with overages, netflix should be paying them as they forcefully ran the ads. Not the customer.   Is this colusion between media corperations and internet service providers to force more data usage and front bill to consumer?? If there is an option to turn off ads then that would fix this concern. Or give all consumers unlimited data packages at fair rates as Canadians have taken the Bananna quite enough lately.

"I keep getting a refund nearly every‚Ä¶: I like Netflix because It allows me to relax to a show on the go, without the need for tv - an added plus is it keeps track of where I am, making it portable enough for moving between devices. Through Netflix, I have been able to discover new shows in areas of interest: Anime:  Violet evergaden, kuroko no basket Classic TV shows, both old and new: How I met your mother, Avatar: The Last Airbender, merlin, Riverdale, and much more It provides all of this at minimal effect to my mobile data, and in actual cost  - it is pretty much free as I‚Äôm using part of a relative‚Äôs quota of users Despite these advantages though, Netflix isn‚Äôt perfect. thus I acknowledge these: Content I want to watch may be limited to other regions, especially within the anime genre. But this is expected with licensing complexity and Netflix‚Äôs general nature Some growing pains with the desktop UI: In general, the feel isn‚Äôt as smooth as mobile and I hope this abstract issue can be fixed by at least providing some smooth animations on navigation buttons and the like. Also, the app tends to get buggy when I‚Äôm connected to wifi that blocks Netflix like at school. To drill down on the previous point:  Downloads still try to stream under such conditions and I sometimes have to restart the app and disconnect from the wifi to access them The app is completely inaccessible while it‚Äôs loading under that condition until it errors out. As a developer, I understand the ease of this approach to error handling, but as a user, I would love it if I could choose to go directly to downloads even when a network connection cannot be made. Just like on the mobile app (always loading the navigation).  In conclusion, I appreciate the ease of reach and quality streaming provided, and I would love for a uniform experience between mobile and desktop.",3,1863,get refund nearly like Netflix allow relax need tv   add plus keep track make portable move device Netflix able discover new show area interest Anime   Violet evergaden kuroko basket Classic tv show old new meet mother Avatar Airbender merlin Riverdale provide minimal effect mobile datum actual cost    pretty free m relative quota user despite advantage Netflix not perfect acknowledge Content want watch limit region especially anime genre expect licensing complexity Netflixs general nature grow pain desktop UI general feel not smooth mobile hope abstract issue fix provide smooth animation navigation button like app tend buggy m connect wifi block Netflix like school drill previous point   download try stream condition restart app disconnect wifi access app completely inaccessible loading condition error developer understand ease approach error handling user love choose directly download network connection like mobile app load navigation   conclusion appreciate ease reach quality streaming provide love uniform experience mobile desktop

"Unauthorised Payment: Well done, Netflix! You have just alienated millions of UK Star Trek fans! What a joke. First, you put on no end of seriously sub-standard junk from all over the world, in multiple languages, the overall ratings for which are all under 2.5 stars, (out of five, obviously). Then you start to show a good series - and then never follow it up with additional seasons. Now you take off all the really good shows and movies. This leaves us with a seriously terrible viewing experience. Why are you doing this to your loyal customers, who wait patiently for their favourite programs, only to be kicked in the teeth, hours before those programs were due to be aired, because you would rather sell off the series and movies which made Netflix so special in the first place? I am not condoning the use of illegal websites, by any means! Let me be clear on that. However, you are forcing people to look elsewhere for the shows and movies you guys used to air! It is disgusting that you show us one or two seasons of a show, then sell the rights to someone else, forcing your customers to pay for other subscriptions. In the case of ""Star Trek - Discovery"", you aired three seasons and then days before season four was to be shown, you take it all away and sell it off to a rival streaming site, which we in the UK cannot access until some time next year! For UK viewers... boycott this ridiculous streaming site, until they can pull their fingers out!

There's a load of foreign series/movies from the past that show outdated stuff. Netflix is becoming a dusty library. Also their new stuff has an overall low quality, just check movie review sites for ratings mostly around 5 out of 10. These new shows seem to be for people with a small world.

"Tripe!: I have just watched the episode on the Royals of the 'explained' series.  Being a media outlet I can understand the need for sensationalism and attracting viewers.  But I find the episode racist and bias against white people.  I feel judged.  Nobody can travel to the past and undo the wrongs.  History is important to us as a guide on what not to do - while moving forward in our progression as this planets inhabitants.  It is not supposed to drag the world back into a past that we want to leave behind.  But that is the message that the episode transmits.  Lets find someone to blame.  The Royals.  I am white, I live in South Africa and this country has been on a regressive path from way before apartheid, because of the same attitude of accusation the episode promotes.  It does not help with any forward movement.  As white, I am discriminated against now.  because of the colour of my skin.   Call it payback if you will and some may find it ammusing.  But it does not make sense to me to be punished and discriminated against when I was only a young teenager in the last 4 to 5 years where apartheid was already dying.  My parents never practiced colour discrimination and we were never taught that way.  ALM - All Lives Matter.  By continuously dredging up the past you are creating racial divide.  The Royals are more than just a social attraction.  They are what nobody wants to admit - strong symbolic leaders who do have the ideal of wanting stability over what they have influence in.   That is what we all want, just a bit of stability so we can go on with our lives.  As organisms, subconsciously that is what we strive for.  It is key to any organisms survival.

"Terrible: My account, which I canceled months prior, was hacked. I received an email stating that my request to change my email was processed. I also saw two charges on my card. I had to call THREE times to try and get this resolved with no success. My card continues to be charged on an account that I closed 5-6 months ago. Two days later, there is another charge from Netflix on my card. Each customer service person stated something different about what had to happen to get the situation resolved. That makes zero sense! The last phone call, I requested to speak with a supervisor, or another person because the guy sounded like he did not know what he was talking about. He refused. Just ignored my repeated requests to speak with someone else. It is unfortunate that a company this size, that makes billions of dollars a year, can not provide appropriate account security or customer service. Since I can not trust that my card information is secure, and l do not believe it is resolved, so I canceled that card. Now I have to go through the hassle of securing a new card because Netflix does not care about adequate security and customer service. Every person I spoke to at Netflix said something different to resolve the problem.

But I could ignore that the Chilling Tales of Sabrina was canceled. I could handle finding out that Santa Clarita Diet would no longer be running. I even held my tongue when only ONE season of ‚ÄúI Am Not OK With This‚Äù was released and quickly canned (even though it left off on an EXTREMELY worrying cliffhanger). BUT NOT THIS. Netflix bullied the original creators out of their own creation of Avatar: The Last Airbender series. Guys, this may not have occurred to you yet, but have you ever stopped to think that maybe the series did so well: BECAUSE ITS CREATORS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING?! It is one of the best written shows in the world with very delicate characters and arcs. And although I have seen some great things, I will not watch this series. Not after hearing you made it so difficult for the people that wrote the original series to have any say on their creation. You all should be ashamed of yourselves and I am HIGHLY disappointed. Also a little angry that the creators didn‚Äôt just pull it all out of your hands altogether. Absolutely disgusted. The one thing I was so looking forward to, and you had to ruin it. It‚Äôs not yours! You don‚Äôt get to sit there and decide what happens to something THAT ISN‚ÄôT YOURS. I hope it‚Äôs a colossal failure so that you wasted that money. I really do.

"1 star as I can‚Äôt give any lower‚Ä¶: Having a very frustrating experience with Netflix due to the decline in number of screens the service is allowing per plan.

This makes it virtually impossible for my family to use, and when weighing the pros and cons of upgrading or dealing with the use of one screen only and the constant communication of who has been watching and what time the account will be occupied, it seems that the best option is to quit the streaming service all together.

"Netflix is a waste of money üí∞ they‚Ä¶: I have been frustrated with Netflix for a long time. Yes, it's great to have a huge collection of shows and films to watch for a very reasonable price. But Netflix often makes the experience unnecessarily annoying. - Interface. The interface is obviously optimized for a TV with very limited input capabilities. Most of the time I am watching on my laptop, however, and I would really, *really* appreciate it if it was possible to have more control over what I get shown and how. Just copying half of the ideas of an arbitrary smart phone media app would already be a huge improvement. - Tenancy. The way shows and films just appear and disappear without warning on Netflix is infuriating. At least let me have a countdown for things that will disappear. - Netflix' own content. Used to be ok with some of it great, now it's mostly rubbish and some of it ok or good. And the cancellation policy simply sucks. No warning, no transparent criteria, shows just disappear. The best you can do is wait until a show is renewed for at least three seasons before you start watching it. - Incomplete content. Great that you got series x which got cancelled on a cliff hanger, season 1 out of 5 of series y and season 2 of series z in a package deal. If you encourage me to watch them, though, at least have the decency to warn me that they are incomplete!",1,1382,Netflix waste money   frustrate Netflix long time yes great huge collection show film watch reasonable price Netflix make experience unnecessarily annoy   Interface interface obviously optimize tv limited input capability time watch laptop appreciate possible control show copy half idea arbitrary smart phone medium app huge improvement   Tenancy way show film appear disappear warn Netflix infuriate let countdown thing disappear   Netflix content ok great rubbish ok good cancellation policy simply suck warning transparent criterion show disappear good wait renew season start watch   incomplete content Great get series x got cancel cliff hanger season 1 5 series y season 2 series z package deal encourage watch decency warn incomplete

It's only until recently, however, that their image in public opinion has been split down the middle, and for me personally, it's not a good one. Raised monthly prices by a fraction, which they'll do every year, removing a vast quantity of shows and movies from the site in the same month, while pushing the woke/LGBT agenda to remain inclusive while pushing for Cuties, which is one of the reasons I cancelled my subscription previously.

"I keep getting a refund nearly every‚Ä¶: I canceled our subscription and I had it since the only way you could use and watch movies from Netflix was through the snail mail! Yes folks... Netflix started somewhere in early 2000 and only did movies on disc via snail mail. I started using it early 2000. Just canceled because... 1.) there are TONS of awesome Netflix tv shows ‚ÄîBUT... BUT.... They CANCEL ALL OF THEM after the first, second or third seasons. It‚Äôs gotten even worse! Several new shows in one year have already been canceled. What‚Äôs even worse... Netflix doesn‚Äôt tell us this. I‚Äôve had original Netflix tv shows on my list for 2 - 3 years, waiting for the next season. I sat the other day ALL afternoon looking up every single original Netflix tv show on my list..... just about every single one had been canceled, including some that just came out in 2020. People are seriously P.O.d about this. We pay for this... they tease us, give excellent shows then cancel them. At least 90% of original Netflix tv shows have been canceled. It‚Äôs a waste of time watching them. 2021 ‚Äî- Original brand new Netflix tv shows came out in 2020, hasn‚Äôt been a year for many, after one season, all canceled. It‚Äôs not because of Covid either! They do this all the time!!! 2.) They are releasing way more foreign films. I live in United States m I don‚Äôt have a problem watching films from other countries or tv shows... but now that‚Äôs all they are releasing! Many of them are absolutely terrible for one reason or another, such as.... the film / show is in another language they dub over for English speaking and the words are way off from their mouths. And can‚Äôt understand a lot of the films or shows because of accents... broken English or just can‚Äôt understand them. Way to many films and shows you have to ‚Äòread‚Äô because it‚Äôs not in English language. I wish there was a way to make Netflix more personal so I could choose for Netflix NOT show me films and shows like this, to choose from. It‚Äôs sad how many I have to read. I crochet while watching films or shows, I can‚Äôt read them. AND we tried... umm there is not enough time to read all sentences before they are gone. And worse... we can‚Äôt watch the film or show WHILE reading the subtitles. It‚Äôs extremely terrible. 3.) They have films and shows that have been in their library for YEARS..... and I mean... YEARS!! Considering how long Netflix has been around, and ALLLLLLLLL the movies ever made, let‚Äôs just say, last 25 years, they haven‚Äôt even play 1% of the movies over the last 25 yrs. They are depending more on their own content but cancel everything before it really gets started. BAD BAD BUSINESS ETHICS!! I can‚Äôt support a company who does such things. There are other reasons, but I don‚Äôt have time to write a book. It seems that Netflix doesn‚Äôt really care about their viewers. We are still waiting to be able to personalize our library more. WHEN if ever can we move our own ‚Äòmy list‚Äô stuff around, the way we want it. I added a bunch of stuff a couple weeks ago. No one can figure out how Netflix determines where it puts it in your list. You would think anything new you add to your list would be at the top, or very bottom right... it IS A LIST AFTERALL. Nope... it sorts them out all over the place. I‚Äôd like to have a list for movies, and a list for tv shows. I‚Äôd love the ability to have everything in my list to be in catagories!! Drama.... Sci Fi... Romance... etc. that way when I‚Äôm in the mood for a particular genre I can go right to that. Netflix was so awesome at one time. I don‚Äôt know who is running this company but it seems like they don‚Äôt know what their doing. Netflix raises prices.... yet, it spends millions of dollars starting NEW original Netflix tv shows... then cancel them? And they wonder why subscriptions are being canceled? Why would anyone pay for a service expecting to watch awesome tv shows seen advertised, then it immediately gets canceled! I‚Äôm waiting for Bridgetown to be canceled, it was released in Jan 2021, only a couple weeks after release they‚Äôve announced season 2 coming. They say it‚Äôs because of its popularity... bull!! They have original Netflix tv shows that were so popular people all over were talking highly of them... then they cancel them. Sorry Netflix, your no longer getting my money when all you do is cancel everything! We don‚Äôt even get to go to a finale of any Netflix tv shows. They complet Leave us hanging. And majority of us are waiting..... and waiting... and still waiting for the next seasons, only to find out much later on.... your original series are canceled.  Many of us have a my list that is extremely long, to hard to read Netflix use to be THE streaming service to have. Now it‚Äôs a joke... I‚Äôve watched Netflix go down hill for several years now.

"Terrible: Recent price increases for multi devices is absurd. It used to be 10.99/mo. Every year they keep increasing the price.

Today, I was watching a new season of a Netflix favourite when have way through the episode a Netflix suggestion kept appearing midway through the show that wouldn‚Äôt let be finish the show I was watching without starting one of the three suggested shows. Clearly a small technical issue that could easily be resolved - or so I thought. I spend two hours on the phone to someone so incompetent half the time she ignored me when I asked is she was still there - the whole call was awkward. Then by the end when I was told it was my internet speed that caused Netflix to advertise their productions in the middle of a tv show that it was clear to me that not only were Netflix incapable of listening but that they had no desire too. I mean what‚Äôs the loss one customer subscription when they have so many. I asked if I could make a complaint about the service and was promised by the person who told me that if I told them my complaint about them that they would pass it on. Needless to say after numerous  call back attempts to try and get this escalated I was told that Netflix don‚Äôt do that, they don‚Äôt deal with customer issues. They have all the same tools to ignore my issue so there‚Äôs no point putting me into someone else. In the heat of the moment I asked them to cancel my account which strangely was the only thing they managed to do without question. But actually listen to my problem, seemed a challenge way about their technical ability.

"Wish I could leave 0 stars: Be very careful¬†if you use Netflix! If you're not it could give your computer an incurable virus! Really, let me explain. A couple of years ago I got really sick. I'm talking about not being able to leave bed, and just wishing that it would just all end. And this is embarrassing to admit but I also needed something playing to help me sleep, I only had Netflix so I used it next to all of the time. Because of all of that Netflix decided that I binge watched to much. They decided to ""punish me"" by automatically skipping over the ""recap"" of the previous episodes,¬†even though¬†I have always wanted to watch it. I personally feel like¬†even if I know what has happened if¬†I don't watch the¬†re-cap then I'm missing¬†something. That's¬†just my opinion, and I thought that is what I was paying for... That went on for over a year. I did not tell many people about this, but the ones that I did tell they all said the same thing ""don't you pay for streaming/binge watching?"" All I could say is ""yes, but I guess Netflix¬†wants to be a dictatorship, and they don't care."" I foolishly thought that maybe if I forced it to go to the very end of every episode then maybe it would fix it. Unfortunately that just ended¬†up making it about 100x worse! Like I said I was foolish thinking that I could fix it and now I feel stupid for not thinking that Netflix would decided to ""punish me"" again by now taking away the the desciption of the next episode, along with the year that the show came out and the running time, and whatever info that might be there. And only giving me about 3 seconds before automatically playing the next episode.¬† The reason why I say it'll give your¬†computer an incurable virus is because this happened at my old apartment. When I first called to cancel my subscription the person that I talked to said that if I start a new account that I should start it with a new email address. I did do that but the issue was still there. When I called back someone said that it must be connected to the IP address. After canceling¬†that account I moved, now I was thinking that it might actually¬†work. Before starting a new account my old laptop broke and I got a new one. (I have never done anything with Netflix on the new router or modem.) So when I got the new laptop I thought that I would try it again. But unfortunately my old laptop has now infected the new IP address. I canceled that account, and tried setting up a new account with my roommates computer, and of course because that computer was on the same IP address the same issue was still there. In that time I have also emailed Netflix¬†to ask them to go ahead and take all of my info off of their site before the 8-10 months (I've been told both time frames, I don't know which one is the real one.)¬† I asked them to take it off from all of the different email addresses I've used with Netflix. (Everytime I made a new¬†account I used a new email address.) They sent me emails confirming that they have all been deleted. When I tried again the problem¬†was still there, I don't think there is anything I can ever do to fix this. I can't go out and buy a new laptop and new router AND modem. Even if I did I really don't think that that'll ever work. So like I said it's an incurable virusthat is extremely infectious to any computer¬†that is¬†on the same IP address. (My roommate is bummed that he can not use Netflix as well!) I really thought that asking them to take my info off would work. But like I said it's incurable. I've had people that I've talked to at Netflix tell me that they are having the tech people look at it/fix it. I don't know if they were just lying to me, or maybe the tech people never even tried to fix it. Either way, I'm tired of paying for a service that does not work properly.¬†¬† I know that since¬†quarantine has gone into effect Netflix has been encouraging people to stay home and binge on Netflix. I just hope that no one listens¬†or that Netflix¬†has stopped giving people incurable viruses. I feel like because Netflix gives people the option¬†to ""skip recap"" then people should have the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to skip or not. And not have Netflix automatically decide for them. Why have that option if they just go ahead and choose for people?¬† I've talked to many people at Netflix (over the phone and by chat) 99% of the time they seem that they don't care at all. And EVERYONE¬†says that that is not a known issue and there is nothing that they can do about it. But Netflix claims that they are all about giving good customer¬†service... I've asked to be transferred to the tech department, but they never allow that. I've even tried ""reporting a problem."" Nothing has ever changed because of doing that. I've ""reported a problem"" MANY¬†times. I don't understand why they don't care. But I'm pretty sure they only care about your money and not the people GIVING the money...

"Tripe!: I signed up as an Standard Definition customer partly because of cheaper cost, but also because it's more environmentally friendly (SD streams have a far lower carbon footprint). Netflix insisted that I must upgrade to HD for free for the first month, no choice to continue with SD. I was then assured that following months would be downgraded to the SD package and charged accordingly. Typically each month I'd get to the point where there was a lack of things to watch, so would cancel the account ahead of it being renewed. Then a few days after cancelling I'd hear about a new series that was good and sign up again. Each time I would be forced with the 'free' HD upgrade. Finally came a month when I didn't cancel. Low and behold, when the credit card statement came for that month I'd been placed onto the full HD package, being charged extra for HD that I didn't even want. This was despite Netflix's assurance I'd be dropped down to SD. I've taken this up with them and they literally couldn't care less. At least with firms like Amazon they endeavour to make things right for the customer. They said they understood my grievance but really they don't at all, and just made me pretty angry. It would have been easy to offer a free month of SD and an apology, but I got neither. Their system is at fault, but even if they were giving me the benefit of the doubt without looking into this, it wouldn't have been a big deal for them. I will have to have a very good reason to ever sign-up with them again. Even if they had put this right, a policy to force users to take an HD package initially when the planet is on fire because the environment is so messed up is in my view very irresponsible in itself. I cannot recommend anyone signs up with Netflix",2,1766,tripe sign Standard Definition customer partly cheap cost environmentally friendly sd stream far low carbon footprint Netflix insist upgrade hd free month choice continue sd assure follow month downgrade sd package charge accordingly typically month d point lack thing watch cancel account ahead renew day cancel d hear new series good sign time force free HD upgrade finally come month not cancel Low behold credit card statement come month d place hd package charge extra hd not want despite Netflixs assurance d drop sd ve take literally not care firm like Amazon endeavour thing right customer say understand grievance not pretty angry easy offer free month sd apology get system fault give benefit doubt look not big deal good reason signup right policy force user hd package initially planet fire environment mess view irresponsible recommend sign Netflix

The new system is less flexible - you're no longer able to watch specific programs with a higher maturity level  by using a PIN (unless you allow someone to access a different profile by giving them the PIN to that profile - but then their programs will show up in your profile and once in that profile they can watch what they want!).   This is a poorly planned and executed ""update"". Not helped by 2 out of 3 customer support enquiries giving wrong or confusing information when I contact them.

"Unauthorised Payment: We have been using Netflix for a while, however, from this February, we have been double charged every month, but we have only one subscription! So we contacted their customer service. They claim that there is another Netflix account has been using our bank info to have subscription. That account was not us! We have only one account on Netflix always. We asked them to refund the double charged months, they refused, saying that probably it is our own fault for clicking some phishing emails! But they have no evidence of sending us any email to warn for a new account using our bank info! Most likely someone hacked our account on Netflix and stoled our bank info to use for him/herself. We asked them to delete our bank info from that account, they said they did. Then guess what? The second day after, we got charged by Netflix again! We were so shocked, so contacted them again.... Apparently the same account or another account (they refused to tell us which one) has started to use our bank info again to pay for their own subscription! I mean seriously! The day before they promised that now our bank info and account is secure with them, and it didn't even last for more than one day! Now we are completely scared to have any information left with Netflix. They must have some secure loop in their system, but they refused to admit and fix it unfortunately. Instead, their strategy is to blame customers for such a loss. We are deeply disappointed on how they reacted and handled this case. We now asked them to delete any information of our account from their system (in Europe we have right to do so due to GDPR). Instead of doing it immediately, they asked us to send an application to some address and then they will deal with it within 20 days. Are you joking?! To subscribe, it is just a click; to quit, it is a hell of work for the customer! But we will do it anyway! Though they have lots of movies and series, so what, I am not willing to stay as a customer since I don't feel secure with my info anymore and they have not show respect to their customers as they should!

The word terrorist which was the dubbed English was subtitled by Netflix as Jihadist.  To clarify, I have no problem with the term jihadist being used when referring to actual jihadists - however jihadist and terrorist do not mean the same thing and should not be used synonymously/interchangeably.  Not only is this racist and islamaphobic but it insights hate towards the muslim community. Watching this at home with my family us all feel attacked in our own home. I contacted Netflix regarding this (what I had hoped to believe was a) mistake via the online chat facility. I was told they had no power to do anything. I then contacted via a customer service number which was extremely difficult to find only to be told they could do nothing as their freelance translators are responsible. If this is the case I am amazed Netflix doesn't have quality controls in check to at the very least filter racist/sexist/homophobic content.  As a major company in 2020 I find this appalling.

"Wish I could leave 0 stars: I have had netflix's for over a decade and have loved every minute of it until today, when I needed customer service for the first time EVER.  Because of Covid I am downsizing my life, and want to keep Netflixs but need to change the card it was being charged to.  It wasn't a long wait until I was speaking to customer representative, Chris on 7/18/20 10:09 (Hawaii Aleutian standard time).  First Chris could not look up the email account that I provided to him clearly and spelt it for him the first time he asked for it. He rudely asking for it and then rudely told me that was not the correct address. I told the email address two more times. Then, I went step by step as he asked me turn on Netflix on my TV and walked me to the info part that shows the address I had FIRST, originally gave him, the only email address I gave him.  I counted that for a small mistake on his part and even though he did not take responsibility for not repeating back the email or clarifying the email on his end, or just plain getting it wrong, we pursued to the  next step where my husband had unfortunately changed his email password  (which is the email connected to Netflix that I needed access too). I asked Chris three different times if there was any other way to get into this account because my husband works nights shifts as was asleep. AGAIN Chris rudely told me that he HAD to send the email to THIS (my husbands) email only. So begrudgingly, I woke up my husband, who did not remember his new password off the top of his head as he sat up in bed, half asleep.   When coming back to tell Chris that wasn't an option,  my husband could not remember his new password, Chris said, ""Okay is there another email to send it to?"" Of course there is! There is mine! I wish we had done that in the first place, which I had inquired about when I asked what our options are so I do not have to wake my husband. Chris said nothing.  At this point I as soooo disappointed in Chris and Netflix's customer service. he sent this link  to my on my email address. When I  hit the link it took me to the log in Netflix page where I would be using  my email instead (which is fine just took sooooo long to get to this point when it didn't have to) I tried all of my passwords I could think of to log in. When none of them worked, I did ask, is this the password to my email? He said no it's the password to your Netflixs account! OMG. Is this guy forreal? I said then, it would have been nice to have be given that instruction. He says nothing. And has apologized for anything on his end for the long process that could have been done so much better with a helpful person and not a person that with his patronizing tone.  Finally, 14 minutes later, I am at the point that I can see where to change my info. I am so irritated with how frustrating and difficult Chris made this for me that I asked to get off the phone and that I could take it from there. When the only time his was tone had changed into a positive one, when he told me to take my time as he wanted to make sure that  I would get the info changed. It was so shocking to me that he wanted to stay on the phone and his tone of voice had changed.  Chris stayed on the phone and when he asked me if I had anymore questions, I just asked for his name.  My husband later said I should have asked for a number of some customer service ID number. But I hadn't.  I have NO idea why he was kind to me the last minute of the conversation. I guess he was trained to stay on the phone until what I wanted to be fix was fixed.  Other than that, Netflixs please hire people that are helpful and kind. They have one job, to be helpful. And in the world we are living in, being kind goes a long way. Very sad to have talked to someone who made mistakes, dismissed my concerns, had me do things the long way, and talked to me in a condescending way, like I was an old lady that have never used technology before, when I am a 34 year old high school teacher that used technology my whole life and is advancing in the way I work with technology everyday of my career, to reach out, to relatem, and connect with my students daily.

There was NO unusual activity at all and when I asked what was meant by that, I got no clear answer.

"Poor customer service: This is an honest to goodness conversation with Netflix! Make up your own mind. You are now chatting with: Joseph Netflix Joseph Hi. Thanks for contacting Netflix. Can I get your name and email to ensure I'm looking at the correct account? You  I am unable to pay for Netflix this is the third day in a row. I have one mastercard, two visa cards and an Amex none of them work. Your email checklist regarding payments has not helped I have gone through all the options. Yes I have plenty of credit, no my cards are not blocked all four of my banks have confirmed it and yes my all my banks state that they list a temporary hold on the account but Netflix does not follow through with transaction. Unless Netflix thinks four different banks and three payment networks are down, this is a Netflix issue not a bank one. I have also tried calling but your lines are down due to Covid 19. Redacted Netflix Joseph I'm looking... You ok thank you Netflix Joseph In customer service, we can't always see the details of why a card didn't work. We also can't make them go through. In this case, I can see that the cards aren't working. The options are to try a different method of payment or use a gift card. Can you tell me what country you're currently in? You united kingdom You those options clearly are not going to work You after four cards that is pointless if you can't see what is going on please contact someone who can and then get back to me by email Netflix Joseph There is no one at Netflix who can make the cards go through. If they don't work on their own when they're tried and the financial institutions can't make it happen either, there's nothing further that can be done. Do you know what country the account was created in? You I believe it was Turkey I was on holiday at the time. In addition of Netflix can't fix their payment processing you can hardly expect me to. You with nothing further to be done all I can do is stop being a customer and leave a bad review. Netflix Joseph I'm asking these questions to find a solution. And we have one. If you cancel the account, it will close. And then you can purchase a gift card in the UK to restart it. You must cancel first because of the currency that it's trying to charge in. A UK gift card won't work on it while it's open. But you will be able to cancel and restart with the gift card. You I have no intention of purchasing gift cards it is waste of time and given the lockdown in the Uk pointless. You I will however cease to be a customer of Netflix and will leave a bad review. Netflix Joseph You can buy them online. I can send you an email with a link that can suggest places to buy them. You I do not wish to purchase gift cards Netflix Joseph Okay. Do you have any other questions about this, then? You no unless you have something helpful to process my payment. Netflix Joseph The one thing which is impossible is making the cards go through. Netflix Joseph Anything else? You I just asked you, if you can do nothing else just say so Netflix Joseph I have given you the only other solution there is...gift cards. Netflix Joseph Anything else? You you can not solved my problem you have just tried to get to buy gift cards Netflix Joseph The only solution to the problem is a gift card.

You also still have time to but some good silly funny things in it that could only happen in a cartoon. I think its a great show and if people take the time to watch they them selfs may find something or a character to relate too. Thank you for the series and can't wait for the next season.

"Resolution drops when price goes up: I've only been using Netflix for a few months, and I've had no issues with the service, the content keeps me entertained and there always seems to be something to watch.  However, I'm rating a one star as last night there was an issue with my account which led to it being hacked and taken over. I feel their security system and fraud prevention measures need some serious upgrades.  I received two emails at 01:51am to say my account had been accessed in Brazil and Columbia and I should change my password if this wasn't me, I was in work in the UK, it definitely wasn't me. So I tried to log in immediately from the app on my phone, only to find my log in details were no longer recognised. I tried to recover password thinking maybe my phone had the wrong password stored (no idea how that would happen), there's no account registered under my email or telephone number. A quick Google of this issue shows other users have faced this problem and their account has been hacked and taken over.  So I looked at contacting Netflix. The only option is to call them, a wait time of 26+ minutes...  I finally get through to a very helpful and patient advisor (can't fault her) who finds my account, confirms yes it has been hacked (although doesn't seem surprised, almost like she deals with this type of call regularly), my login email has been changed, phone number has been removed. The only way she is able to save my account is she requires the last eight digits of the payment card. Now I'm in work on a nightshift, no shops are open so I never take my cards with me to work on nights, there's no other way to verify my identity. I could wait until I finish work in 8 hours time, but then the the hackers will have had my account for 8 hours and I also face the frustrating wait time to get through to someone to go through the process again.  The only other option, terminate my account there and then. I was then given a code, effectively a gift card, of my remaining balance for the month, not offered a refund, so automatically presuming I'll sign up again. While it is an inconvenience having to set up the account and find all my programs again, it's not a major issue, but I don't see why Netflix doesn't have something in place like a lot of other providers, that where the main email address of the account holder is changed, the company sends the account holder an email or text alert immediately, to say your email has been changed, and if you didn't make this change, please click here and the change will be stopped. Giving you the opportunity to get in to your account to change your password or request a new password if the hacker has already changed it. It would save a lot of hassle and probably bring down the wait time on calls to get through to you.  Now, you do send an email alert, a pretty pointless one, as my account was hacked at 01:51am (time I received login alerts), I received an email at 11:18am to say ""We've changed your email address, as you asked (I didn't ask, but thanks for assuming, Netflix). You will no longer be able to use your email to sign in to Netflix. If you didn't ask to change it, just contact us (via telephone!)"".  Really Netflix?? 9.5 hours after the address has been changed and 9 hours after I've closed the account, you send me this email?? This should be immediate and it should be questioned with me, not told ""you will no longer be able to use your email to sign in to Netflix"". For such a huge company, you really need to up your game.

"Just had to Lower my subscription and‚Ä¶: The service generally works well, except when it hiccups and keeps locking you out of your account (like, if you get a new phone, or replace your blu-ray player).  Then the Indian rep (who will claim his name is 'Skip' while repeatedly mangling your first name in an attempt to sound friendly) repeats the mantra of 'reset your password' and unhelpfully insists on sending you a page of ""how to secure your account"" instructions that will contain such gems as ""don't share your password with strangers."" Note that checking my streaming history (once I got back in ) showed NO strange activity. Nobody watching House of Cards on my account in Bangalore or Pyongyang.  It wouldn't be so irritating if they were just able to say: ""yeah, the system screws up every now and then."" But they can't. It's your fault somehow, so keep resetting your password (locked out, changed password, locked out again - for 3 days, this time).  I hung up when 'Skip' said he wanted my payment card number (yes, this was at Netflix's toll-free number, the one on the website). Called back and waited 10 minutes for a supervisor who wanted me to change my password AND my email address. But she did get me back into my account, without asking for a credit card number. For now.

"Tricked by Netflix into getting me off basic plan: Sadly Netflix has really let me down. I used to be a big fan (back when Season 1 of the Crown arrived). In the past few years I've seen the service become complacent, with hardly any films or TV shows being worth watching.  Perhaps Netflix isn't really for me, apparently Adam Sandler movies are the most popular thing on the platform and I'm definitely NOT a fan of his silly comedy films (although the Wedding Singer is great :) To be honest, most/all the recommend shows and movies are not interesting to me and I've had several issues with my account - they overcharged me, accidentally cancelled my account and then wouldn't accept my card when I tried to re-join a few months back.  I think most of the films I'd like don't get added because I'm not their typical Adam Sandler loving customer. That's fair enough and I hate to write bad reviews, I just can't recommend them. They've gone downhill and don't seem to be improving. I did like the Irishman and several other films, but there's just not enough good new content on Netflix to be worth the monthly price. The thing is, they could be so good, especially considering the amount of money they spend on content, they could be the best, but they've become complacent (like a lot of other big companies that take their customers for granted).",1,1353,trick Netflix get basic plan Sadly Netflix let big fan Season 1 Crown arrive past year ve see service complacent hardly film tv show worth watch   Netflix not apparently Adam Sandler movie popular thing platform m definitely fan silly comedy film wedding Singer great   honest mostall recommend show movie interesting ve issue account   overcharge accidentally cancel account not accept card try rejoin month   think film d like not add m typical Adam Sandler love customer s fair hate write bad review not recommend ve go downhill not improve like Irishman film s good new content Netflix worth monthly price thing good especially consider money spend content good ve complacent like lot big company customer grant

"Terrible: After reading the reviews on hear it has confirmed my thoughts about Netflix. I have been a member for some time &  It started Years ago when Knight rider series was on the UK site and all of a sudden it vanished? I did some research and it was on the US site but taken from the UK one? Apparently there are Hundreds if not thousands of shows the UK does not get that the US one does. This in itself is not acceptable. Something very wrong has happened to this service. Every time I log into it I end up spending half an hour searching for films and giving up wasting time and just logging out. They used to have 80s rare films (The keep) and I would enjoy seeing them reborn in HD. They just don't have anything like that any more and one of the most annoying things is they delete them from there server. Its not fair. Like someone else stated when you rate a movie it should keep it in your library and the ones you don't like should be not displayed. Over the previous Christmas period there were practically no proper Xmas films...How can this be?????? What they are doing is putting major releases like Stranger things and the Witcher and deliberately cheeping out on the rest of the content. I do not consider stand up comedy shows or Indian films ""latest releases"". I don't have any need for this content at all. Its unfair to push it on everybody. The menu system is totally confusing..New, previous, this week - Talk about infuriating. I work in the cinema industry and know for a fact Netflix are not putting any previous films on that have been at Theatres. This is absurd in itself. There seems to be a general trend for this service to be turning into the BBC. They are basically trying to tell us what to think instead of watch and I for one am certainly not prepared to have to pay a fee for that. The service was "" Fun "" when it was created and now its just "" Infuriating"". There is literally no good content on it. The films are total rubbish with zero interest. I am constantly fed up with expecting new content and being greeted with last Months films being classed as new releases. The customer service is a joke and the staff arrogant. Netflix take note you need to up your game if you are to survive. Movies are something that helps a persons day to day life and not just a Money milking scheme to bleach the hell out of loyal customers. Where in your contract of sale does it state its ok to abuse the public in this way. I have had enough..No Xmas films at December was the last straw. I dont want or care for stand up comedy shows of someone making an absolute fool of themselves classed as latest releases or Indian films that have zero interest. You have tried to bleach everyone with mediocre content and your ship is sinking fast. I am cancelling my subscription and going to Amazon prime or other better choices than this total rubbish.

"Charged for a cancelled service: Netflix has repeatedly screwed up the website, the most egregious problem is that now there is no way to even SEE ""my list"", let alone manually reorder it. What they now call ""my list"" or ""my library"" is the same thing--a scroll through showing of the cover image for each title, which has to be clicked individually to get a description of that title. It leaves off at least two thirds of the items I actually have in my actual list, and there is NO WAY now to reorder anything at all. Until yesterday, I could still at least see my actual list to identify what titles are being removed this week and this month, although the manual reordering has been dysfunctional for over a month. Now it is completely gone, no way to even begin to see what I have let alone what's being removed or move any title to the top of my list.

My daughter used my account and changed it to Greek. So I have contacted them to return the Arabic subtitles but they kept talking about the license and nonsense.  If you live in a certain country, it doesn't necessarily you speak or read the local language. you have to have what is suitable for your needs and the company's' needs.  I have chatted with them many times but they were talking like Robots, eventually they were talking very rudely.  I will copy the conversation to see how rude they are ""You I live in Greece. I had Arabic subtitles over a year on my account. Now I can't have Arabic subtitles. I need you to make the necessary settings from your side to have Arabic subtitles again.

My children can't read Arabic You I had the background in English but the subtiles were in Arabic Vaughn Rouge Netflix Okay. Again we are just doing this to see if you can get Arabic subtitles this way. But otherwise, I want to inform you that sometimes subtitle languages leave Netflix due to licensing agreements/copyright issues per region, especially if you're in a different country. So there will be no way we can get you back Arabic subtitles right away. The best we can do is take this as a feedback so we can see what we can do about it. You ok. first step is to get the first setting please and remove the Arabic. Vaughn Rouge Netflix I've changed your profile language back to English now. You second to check how you can get me back the Arabic subtitles. You ok. Vaughn Rouge Netflix As I've checked here, Arabic subtitles are no longer available on Brooklyn nine-nine. Again, the reason behind it is because of licensing agreements/copyright issues per region, especially if you're in a different country. There's nothing we can do for now to bring back the Arabic subtitles as it goes through a long process first, so the best we can do is take this as a feedback from you. You ok.

"Just had an email stating my plan is‚Ä¶: As much as anyone may love and use Netflix, their security is horrendous. I have seen countless cases where people have had fraudulent payment be made to them but they ""can't"" do anything about it. My mum had an email regarding a suspicious login, but they let said login immediately change the email address and password on the account. Netflix literally ""can't"" do anything about it because they ""can't"" trace across old details against accounts, nor find an account based on the payment details. Their solution is literally just create a new account because your old one is gone now.  The Netflix security is unacceptable, and I can't recommend anyone use it until they add 2 step authentication, like every other major service does. And considering they are a high target for using stolen bank details, they should probably step up to help their customers crack down on this.",1,918,email state plan love use Netflix security horrendous see countless case people fraudulent payment not mum email suspicious login let say login immediately change email address password account Netflix literally not not trace old detail account find account base payment detail solution literally create new account old go   Netflix security unacceptable not recommend use add 2 step authentication like major service consider high target steal bank detail probably step help customer crack

"Continually locks up my smart TV!!!: As a natural binge watcher, when I found out about Netflix, it stole my heart.  Science fiction, fantasy, comedies, horrors... Netflix has it all.  But in the last year I‚Äôve started to notice the NEW Netflix flaws that I‚Äôve never witnessed before. (If Netflix ever had flaws, fans could tolerate it due to everything that Netflix has to offer)  As a foreigner I prefer to watch my movies and shows with ENGLISH subtitles because it helps me understand and learn everything 1000%.  I‚Äôve spotted so many shows and movies that subtitles don‚Äôt match the words the actors are saying ( for something as big as Netflix, that should NEVER be happening )  And my biggest issue.  How many shows have been cancelled after two or three seasons?! Santa Clarita Diet, Disjointed, Hemlock Grove and FIVE marvel series?! ( I didn‚Äôt even count in the good ones )  From a binge watchers point of view, this is outrageous. Why do we pay for Netflix if they add dozens of NEW series every year but never go for more than a few seasons with the ones we already have?!  How does Netflix  expect their fans to commit? Netflix thinks that as long as they keep putting out new stuff, we‚Äôll be happy?! Ohh, no.  If we committed to Netflix that means that we want to commit to our favourite shows as well  and not have to worry that it will be cancelled after 10-20 episodes.  I can‚Äôt say. There have been a lot of shows that have been cancelled after a season or two but only Netflix has the biggest choice of movies and shows but NEVER enough seasons.  Netflix has bitten off more than it can chew and that is why everyone will stop paying for it and find something worth their loyalty!  In the soon future, Netflix will be forgotten just like MySpace. Why? Netflix has taken its ‚Äúfame and popularity‚Äù for granted!",1,1826,continually lock smart tv natural binge watcher find Netflix steal heart   Science fiction fantasy comedy horror Netflix   year ve start notice NEW Netflix flaw ve witness Netflix flaw fan tolerate Netflix offer   foreigner prefer watch movie show ENGLISH subtitle help understand learn 1000   ve spot show movie subtitle not match word actor say   big Netflix happen    big issue   show cancel season Santa Clarita Diet Disjointed Hemlock Grove marvel series   not count good one    binge watcher point view outrageous pay Netflix add dozen new series year season one   Netflix   expect fan commit Netflix think long put new stuff happy Ohh   commit Netflix mean want commit favourite show   worry cancel 1020 episode   not lot show cancel season Netflix big choice movie show season   Netflix bite chew stop pay find worth loyalty   soon future Netflix forget like MySpace Netflix take fame popularity grant
"Tired of subtitles: Host of movies and shows to choose from, which is awesome obviously but there's a lot of room for improvement. My husband loves action and war movies, but the vast majority of them are in another language, like Korean or something. And don't have the option for subtitles at least, which really sucks. I don't know if it's at all possible, but constantly updating the site with a series' newer episodes would be wonderful, instead of having to wait until God knows when to hear about the release date for the newest season of a show. When searching for a movie that's not even on the site, it probably will still pop up, though it's not actually available. I also think that it takes too long to update with new shows and movies. People can oftentime run out of things to watch that peak their interest pretty fast. I like that Netflix tries to add to the variety by making their own films, which is a nice attempt. Overall, I use it and think it's ok, but I definitely have to have Hulu or some other streaming service to go along with it because it won't cut it working alone.",2,1098,tired subtitle Host movie show choose awesome obviously s lot room improvement husband love action war movie vast majority language like Korean not option subtitle suck not know possible constantly update site series new episode wonderful instead have wait God know hear release date new season search movie s site probably pop actually available think take long update new show movie People oftentime run thing watch peak interest pretty fast like Netflix try add variety make film nice attempt Overall use think ok definitely Hulu streaming service will not cut work
"Netflix is a waste of money üí∞ they‚Ä¶: I find myself with very mixed feelings about this service, a few years ago it was absolutely great, good shows & fair prices. .

The originals, which were at one time the best shows/films on the service, now seem low quality & rushed, choosing to upload as many as possible rather than spending time & resources on making a couple of good ones.  It isn't all bad though, for killing time at the end of the day there are worst things out there, however the rising price of a subscription doesn't seem to be reflected in the overall experience & that's a real shame, especially considering this hasn't always been the case..",1,946,Netflix waste money   find mixed feeling service year ago absolutely great good show   fair price    content upload little regard quality quantity show particularly young viewer completely random season   particular order completely abandon long reach sort conclusion original time good showsfilm service low quality   rush choose upload possible spend time   resource make couple good one   not bad kill time end day bad thing rise price subscription not reflect overall experience   s real shame especially consider not case

They, however, refused to refund my money even though they admitted that it was a Netflix error. It is only a small amount which in itself does not bother me but if this is multiplied by the hundreds, perhaps thousands of people world wide who fell into the same trap then it is little wonder why Netflix make so much money. I feel that it is bordering on fraud or at the very least dubious practise. I asked to whom I could speak to to progress my complaint and was told that there was no facility for this, they do not have a complaints department!!

I love the service netflix provides and love netflix originals even more but the netflix library is often difficult to navigate when looking for older or less popular titles of specific genres. Netflix also has a problem with not providing the highest resolution streams on chrome and you may have to use edge/safari/app to access the higher resolution streams. Overall, an awesome service but with many flaw that detract from the entire experience. I hope that Netflix can address some of these concerns for customers down under. p.s. a one person UHD streaming plan would be awesome! p.s. can we get lucifer s3 or b99 s5 anytime this year?? they've been out for a while now on other platforms so would be great to get access to them soon please.",4,1154,ability watch subtitle different language ad lot content having longtime subscriber netflix launch australia thoroughly enjoy australian netflix constantly face heavily delay release popular show suffer lack title properly fill different genre interesting title love service netflix provide love netflix original netflix library difficult navigate look old popular title specific genre Netflix problem provide high resolution stream chrome use edgesafariapp access high resolution stream overall awesome service flaw detract entire experience hope Netflix address concern customer ps person UHD streaming plan awesome ps lucifer s3 b99 s5 anytime year ve platform great access soon

Jaynine/Jabnine some different spelling of the name was my assistant. I was already irritated as all hell, trying my best not to be out of my way rude (I was pretty blunt, but tried not to take out my frustration on her throughout the convo. I just wanted a solution). She wasn't terribly knowledgeable at all with the issue, or she didn't care to actually help me with the ACTUAL issue, not sure which one.  I told her if I couldn't get this figured out I'd have to cancel as the account that's currently attached is a bank account I no longer have access to to deposit money into but will not be shutting down either. I did NOT want an overdraft fee. She apparently tried to charge the new card and told me it declined each time. I asked her if I were to try later today, tomorrow, next week, whatever, maybe there's a chance it'd work? Just a glitch in the moment? She replied by telling me it was rejecting the card because that specific card didn't accept recurring payments... I told her that's really strange because I have several auto pays connected to that card already. She essentially gave up and started suggesting other options for me like buying a gift card (I live out in BFE, it's not exactly the easiest for me to go and get one. I'm lucky to even get to my bank). I explained how this was an issue for me and she pretty much told me that's all she's got. I remember even just a few years ago, if you had issues like these, they'd either offer helpful advice, try a few different things as a fix, or work with you for some sort of solution and try to keep you as a customer even if it seems all else fails, not just intentionally let a customer go due to THEIR technical difficulties. There were no other attempts at a solution.  I called my bank and they called BS on it as well, said it is absolutely allowed and there are no restrictions placed on my account.

Since I've used it this way have discovered a number of really good series that I would never have watched if they hadn't been on Netflix. One other frustration I have with them is that they sometimes don't have all of the series of a programme available, which makes very little sense to me - it's frustrating when you've really got into a series with 6 seasons only to find Netflix has Seasons 1-5.

To explain in more detail I complained about the fact that a series I started to watch on Netflix ... Vikings suddenly disappeared.  There was not prior warning of this and no indication this would occur. On contacting Netflix they were completely unhelpful.  They couldn't care less and just explained their license expired and I can see it's going to expire.  I have no info that this would expire.  When complained this was not good enough and what they were going to do to compensate me they say they will do nothing.  I said this is not the level of customer service I expect and I have been a long term customer and this is not expected service level. If this is how Netflix are going treat customers I'll just cancel my account. To this she couldn't care less. I asked to pass me through to a manager. She refused and eventually said she would. Left me on hold for over 10 mins imho was simply hoping I hung up!!!! On finally answering again she was about to make more excuses and fob me off once again! I asked her to give me some simple answers  1. Why she left me on hold for so long?! 2. Is she going to pass me onto a manager or not? 3. Wanted to ask what compensation would be provided?! But she had the nerve to accuse me of being rude to her and just hung up!!!! If this is the sort of service Netflix want to provide customers then you can go to hell! The call lasted 16mins or so in total and I've attached a screen shot. She accessed my account as she's asked for me email id. the caller ended at 2007 GMT 2/3/18. You should be able to pull her records and the call from this! Ofcourse I'm extremely angered at  A) being fobbed off from the start by unhelpful staff  B). No show that I was expecting  C) ignorant stuck up rude staff who couldn't give s damn about customer care  D) not being passed to a manager, be given a call ref, or name.  E) the complete nerve of netflix and your staff to think you are too big and too important to care for your customer or provide any decent service or care to operate customers!  I wouldn't be phoning you up if everything was fine would I?!  What are you going to do to resolve this if anything? If this is not resolved quickly I want it ESCALATed within 2 week max!

"Netflix is a waste of money üí∞ they‚Ä¶: In 2016 was bought Sony Bravia TV with Android. This TV is ‚ÄúNetflix ready device‚Äù with availability to access Netflix movies and TV shows streamed over the Internet. I was frustrated, I did not find movies of interest to me and decided to cancel my membership prior to the end of the free trial period. English is not my native language. I thought that I had found the option to cancel service from TV set. I tried two times to cancel the service but money from my bank's account was taken by Netflix.I could not get info from Netflix.com how I can do it. It is naive to think that from device ready to connection is also possible to cancel the service. I decided to breach the contract by blocked payments from my bank account.   Last month Bank`s Statement surprised me ‚Äì Netflix received payment. This becomes serious. I was starting to a serf on the internet looking for other experience and ways to get contact with Netflix staff.  I did it and I cancel my membership in a traditional way, my bill had every month increased for 8.99. Netflix staff spoke with me kindly, polite and after my story, I got minus payment for 3 months. Also was sent ‚ÄúNetflix terms of use‚Äù to make sure that I have no justice. I have got reading material. When I became a member of Netflix I red Terms of Use superficially and as a result of this, I missed information that breach of contract is possible only from My Account.  Why can I not make the cancellation of service from the same device what was used for connection to it? Why there no other information on the Home page about the way to make cancellation in Netflix.com? Why Netflix did not breach the contract and continue to count the service charge more than the year if in Terms of Use I can read ‚Äúwe may suspend your access to the service until we have obtained valid Payment Method‚Äù? Why I have not received any invoice for this period if in Terms of Use I can read ‚Äúwe will send you information relating to your account (e.g. payment, authorizations, invoices, changes in password or Payment Method, confirmation messages, notices)in electronic form only, for example via emails to your email address provided during registration. ‚Äù The above suggests to me that this is not a customer friendly company.

I asked why this was an option for payment on the app if it didn't work.   The person just kept repeating the same line that it was nothing to do with them, they couldn't help and that I need to contact Google Play.   All i wanted was to know why they offered Google Play as a payment option if it didn't work,  so I asked to speak to someone who did know the answer and I was told to phone back myself.  I asked for the name of the person I was speaking to and they hung up on me.   DON'T EXPECT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM NETFLIX.

"Tired of subtitles: I live in Cambodia as a British Expat. Initially all went well. I have very patchy wifi where I live so I downloaded in the daytime, then watched offline in the evening. One night, I got home and all my downloads were missing. It said it couldn't connect to wifi (which I don't have really anyway).  Next day I chatted to customer service and they said it's because the wifi was turned on and the service was trying to connect rather than being in the offline mode, so just turn off wifi when at home (on my tablet and all will be well).  OK for about a week but it happened again. Next day I chatted online and was told that because I had crossed the border to Thailand for a few days, there were syncing issues. I explained that when it happens, I have no wifi at home so can't watch anything at all, nor chat to customer service. They said it definitely won't ever happen again, and gave me a regular number that they promised would be free to call even from Cambodia. Happened again, called the number, all of my phone credit was wiped out as it's charged full rate. Nowadays, it happens about once a week, all my downloads just disappear. Eventually it connects but the download buttons are missing, it's stream only and keeps skipping.  Even when this isn't happening, often I successfully download something, watch it halfway through, suddenly the app gives me a message there's a problem with the download and it won't play any further. Download it again and the same thing, but no explanation.  But there's nothing to do. No email to write to. Just chat, and the chat people say it's a sync issue, whatever that means. Maybe this works ok domestically in the US but my experience is that it is, to be generous, a beta service in Asia/traveling and not really suitable in it's current state.

"I enjoy the movies: My 1st experience with Netflix was a 30-day trial period. I was able to use the service as time permitted with no issues. Having received a $150 gift card at Christmas, I decided to open an account and become a regular user of the Netflix service. I attempted to watch movies, but for some odd reason, I could not connect to the service. After (3) days, I phoned Netflix's tech support for assistance. That turned out to be 2.50 hour call with no resolution. They tried to troubleshoot the problem but the final result was a verbal insult the agent didn't realize I could hear (when she thought the call was muted). That led to my request to cancel altogether.       The worse part of this is that Netflix refused to refund the $150. They say their policy prevents them from refunding gift cards. I didn't ask for another gift card,.. I just wanted them to refund me the $150 VALUE of the card.        I ended up filing a complaint with the Attorney General in my state. That took several months ... and it was a waste of time. I read reviews and discovered that tons of people are disgusted with Netflix as well. I only wish I had thought to read reviews before I decided to open the account.        It's AMAZING how little protection the consumer really has.

"Charged for a cancelled service: Hello, I used Netflix several months in germany without problems on a 4k samsung tv with smart hub. Then after 7 months, some contents stopped and started reloading always at about half of the the movies/episodes i watched. Not all, but some. Now nearly every content shows the problem now for me (Narcos, Stranger Things, most movies). The problem cant be cause by my internet connection, got 100 Mbit/s connection and bigger downloads sometimes even run with 11 MB/s. The same time the problem occurs, i can watch the same content on my pc without problems. And the problem is outstanding systematic: The content stops somewhere after the half of it, reloads until 25 % and shows a subtitle of a scene some minutes (most times around 2 min) ago. And after restarting the content out of the main menu, it shows the exact scene of the wrong subtitle! And tata, the same problem occurs about 2 min, even if i scroll over the scene. It cost me over 3 hours of calls with the support hotline to make clear to them, that its definitly a problem of their app with the TV. I restarted and did everything as they told me (router, wifi, lan, smart hub reset, tv reset with the lost of the whole program list, thanks), and it changed nothing. After getting to that point that netflix accepted the fact, that the app is the problem, they wanted to inform their development team with a precise description. And what happend, NOTHING! Even my demand to reset my whole account on their database to get rid of a possible problem with timestamps (I'm working in the QM of a company that develops apps), the support refused, not possible. So people at netfilx, if you aren't able to maintain an app that is delivered with a smart-tv and not willing to react on clear problems on some devices with it, i'm no more willing to be a netflix client.

My only complaint is that it is impossible to see ALL of the new titles that are available. I realize that they are trying to help, but their algorithm is only guessing at what you might like based on what you've already watched. Well,...  the problem with that is if a title I want isn't shown then I don't even KNOW that I could have watched it. I have to go to other websites every month in order to find out what they are actually going to be offering, and to know in advance what is going to be taken off. These websites aren't always accurate, but that's better than not knowing at all. Believe me, I've complained about this over and over and so far nothing has changed. And like others say, thanks to this practice, viewers are all too frequently presented with the same titles over and over--even titles that you've already watched (and rated) and THAT is annoying. Still, I find plenty to watch and am getting my money's worth.

"Terrible: So I actually wanted to review the new proxy I found, Proxmate, which gets around the Netflix VPN ban and makes the site worthwhile again.  However since Proxmate is not on Trustpilot I'll leave that review here instead and perhaps someone will find it useful. So yes, get Proxmate for $10 a year and Netflix works again.  Also, in the event that anyone responsible for pressuring Netflix to enforce the ban finds this I'll say...  You wanted VPNs banned to enforce international copyright laws and prevent 'illegal' viewing of content unlicensed or licensed elsewhere in some countries. As a result of doing this (before finding Proxmate) I simply went immediately back to just pirating the content (as I did before Netflix came along). All the efforts made by content creators, studios and producing companies to prevent piracy have made almost no difference to the levels of piracy. Netflix however gave everyone a cheap, easy and legal alternative and made far more of a dent in the piracy figures than anything else. Preventing people using VPNs is only going to force them back to piracy and undo all the good that Netflix has done to stop it...  Oh and also whilst I am here (and since Netflix have stopped responding to my constant emails about this subject)... the new site design is utterly dreadful. It used to work perfectly and be very easy to browse and now... well half the time the play button just vanishes on me and the other half programs which I know full well are available don't appear in searches or have half the seasons missing.

"Tired of subtitles: I am from the US living in a foreign country. I am now retired having sold my company that I owed and operated solely in the country that I am still living in and was using a VPN to receive Netflix  programming from the United States. When Netflix made the decision to block all VPNs I personally as well as several others I know were personally affected. The problem that this has caused is that my hearing is very poor and getting worse as time goes on and the country I live in does not offer English subtitles with very little of their Netflix offerings. Having invested almost all the money from the sale of my company into a home and the property for it my wife and I are living on a very limited income and Netflix was one of the few luxuries we afforded ourselves. I know you're all thinking why don't I just get a hearing aid but number one, is the money issue and number two, I have tried several different models and I still, even with the use of a hearing aid, have a problem understanding a lot of spoken words. Consequently I have already canceled my Netflix subscription and will not be renewing it until this issue is resolved. I also have several friends that were using the English subtitles to help them learn English. I am currently searching for other alternatives among which is Amazon prime which seems to have a great programming lineup and a lot of other benefits and a slightly cheaper price when purchasing a year subscription and so far is not blocking any VPNs that I know of. I believe that by taking this stance Netflix has not taken the old, poor, and nearly deaf into account and in doing this is showing that they are clearly prejudiced against the old, handicapped, and financially limited and could by some seen to be racist as well.

"Charged for a cancelled service: Yes, Netflix is a great idea and all that, I wholeheartedly agree. My problem is that when I signed up for a free one-month trial and cancelled a month later, I was charged for 2 months' worth of viewing - for one month of something that should have been free. I chatted with them on their live chat and spoke to two people whose first language was definitely not English. Both were also pretty unprofessional to the point where I was worried I had signed up to a fake version of Netflix. Comments like ""Yaaay you're back online, so I don't have to close this chat!"" and ""I am so glad that you are chatting into me today"" didn't fill me with confidence. Apparently, the reason for the charges was that Netflix detected that the household I used it in had been used previously for a free trial. But, I'm pretty sure that Netflix has the technology to figure out if the device is using the free trial, not the household. Regardless, I received no emails, no contact to tell me that they suspected this had happened. Instead they decided to charge me on the sly.

"Terrible: When I initially signed up for Netflix, I was a bit skeptic, particularly about the service's ability to compete against the concentration of power in the media industry i.e. a handful of companies controlling content and resisting change. However, Netflix has won me over with its ability to strike good content deals, exclusives like Breaking Bad, and originals that are turning out to be better than anything seen in recent times. House Of Cards, in particular, is a great example of the future of television, which might as well be an obsolete term in a few years thanks to Netflix.",1,596,terrible initially sign Netflix bit skeptic particularly service ability compete concentration power medium industry ie handful company control content resist change Netflix win ability strike good content deal exclusive like break Bad original turn well see recent time House Cards particular great example future television obsolete term year thank Netflix

"Wish I could leave 0 stars: We've been Netflix subscribers at my household for years now, and never have we been let down.  Even long before ""Watch Instantly"", a feature allowing you to view certain movies immediately at your computer or other home media device, Netflix was the greatest with an incredibly large selection of DVDs, delivered FAST to your door.  One great thing about Netflix in the early days was the complete lack of LATE FEES, which no one had dared try before.  With Netflix, you can keep a DVD as long as you want.  The deal is, you can only keep a certain number of DVDs with you at once, so if you want to see more, you gotta send 'em back.  However, since they added the Watch Instantly feature, Netflix has become even greater.  You can watch a good selection of movies and TV shows instantly on your computer or other web-enabled media device (like a PS3, Wii, or Apple TV).  The selection is limited to what the studios and copyright holders allow, but there is plenty to keep you entertained.  Lately there has been a lot of negative talk about Netflix's rates increasing.  I don't want to go into this too much here, but the truth is that Netflix is being pressured by studios and copyright holders to pay them more money.  For Netflix to stay around, they have to charge more to keep up with greedy studio executives.  And even still, they're asking for the right to stream more and more movies through the Watch Instantly program.
